# rust-mlops-template
A work in progress to build out solutions in Rust for MLOPs


## Motivation

One of the key goals of this project is to determine workflows that do not involve the #jcpennys (Jupyter, Conda, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn) stack for #mlops. In particular I am not a fan of the conda installation tool vs containerized workflows that use the Python Standard Library (Docker + pip + virtualenv) and this is a good excuse to find other solutions outside of that stack.  For example:

  * Why not also find a more performant Data Frame library, faster speed, etc.
  * Why not have a compiler?
  * Why not have a simple packaging solution?
  * Why not have a very fast computational speed?
  * Why not be able to write both for the Linux Kernel and general purpose scripting?
  * Why not see if there is a better solution than Python (which is essentially two languages scientific python and regular Python)?
