## A lambda function that async summarizes every object in every bucket

It requires you to deploy with a role that can access S3.
Then do `make invoke`

```bash
{
  "req_id": "46ce6303-f0f3-48cd-9d80-118538f41458",
  "msg": "Event Payload size.",
  "size": "Total size of all buckets: 114.20 GB"
}
```
